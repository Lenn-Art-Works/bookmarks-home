# Bookmarks Home

Welcome to my personal bookmarks assistant. You can add this site (index.html) to your homepage/ new tab page/ a marked page or somewhere else in your browser. You need to install the manifest as a unpacked chrome extension so you can use this software without any issues.

Opening the index.html will lead you through every important steps for creating your own booksmarks. With the extension icon you can add bookmarks directly from one page into the bookmarks home. 

The extension is coded for Chromium so it will run in a lot of native browsers like Chrome, Opera, Arc, Edge...



# Disclaimer

This is my first official coding project I'm publishing here on GitHub. Unfornately the installation is a bit harsh for now (I hope I can fix this in the future). Also the code is pretty much spagetti as I learned everything on my own without learning any coding and structure standards. I used a lot of ChatGPT's help so it could be hard to create your own projects out of this.

All in all I really like where this project is going and didn't want to throw away all this hard invested time and frustration by running this project only on my hardware. 

Let me know what you think about this project. I'm open for new ideas and changes. I have a whole Notion site filled with bug fixes and feature ideas, so there will come a lot of updates in the future.
